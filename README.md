## Part 1

### Goals
1. Import the dataset called `Spotify_Charts.csv`
2. Filter the dataset to only include
    + Artist = "Ed Sheeran"
    + Data after December 31st, 2020
    + Save the result to a new dataframe
3. Determine which Ed Sheeran song experienced the most amount of "MOVE_UP" trends
4. Filter the new Ed Sheeran dataset by sub-setting solely "Shape of you". 
5. Create a histogram of number of daily streams
    + Bin size = 10
    + What are the range of values that occur most frequently? 


#### NOTE:
The file `Spotify_Charts.csv` was too large for me to upload to Github. You'll need to place this file in Data on your end. 

## Part 2

### Goals
Find and download a dataset of your choosing, preferably a dataset that piques your interest.  
 
Complete exploratory data analysis on this dataset in a Jupyter notebook. As a reminder, there is 
no set-by-set guide that is applicable to each dataset, as every dataset is different. However, your 
goals in general are to: 
- Understand your variables 
- Clean the dataset 
- Analyze the relationship between variables 
In addition, please meticulously annotate your notebook with your thoughts as you progress 
through the EDA process, writing down new questions that arise as you observe and analyze your 
data as comments. Not only is this best practice, but youâ€™ll be able to reference your analysis in 
detail in the future. The code is secondary to your thought process and insights about your 
findings. 


## Findings / Results
I believe this was a great assignment. It gives us real world practice with data where you we need to group by, find sums, etc. In the past I've watched videos about Data Science and they indicate they're tasked with finding results of data within a few days. It's nice to see how easy/quick that can be when you:
1. Have the necessary data
2. Know the questions you need/want to answer.
